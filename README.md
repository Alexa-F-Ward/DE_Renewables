# Data Engineering Project: Renewable Energy
A data pipeline for energy production, and a regression algorithm for energy planning.

# Scope & Overview
Due to climate change we are seeing a lot of divergence from non-fossil-fuel energy production and instead diverting towards nuclear or renewable energies. There are problems with both however; nuclear has a lot of backlash due to the Fukushima and Chernoybl disasters, leading to public perception towards the energy production waning. This is especially prevalent in Germany, where they have systemically decommissioned many of their nuclear power plants.
Renewable energies have much more popularity among the public, yet some of the most popular come with limitations: solar and wind power are both excellent energy sources but require sun and wind to maximise their wattage. 

The end result of this project will be an energy production predictor that will determine current potential GWh production against historical usage per nation. This will then be displayed as a dashboard.
